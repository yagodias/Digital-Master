                In cosmology, dark matter is a postulated form of matter that does not interact with ordinary matter, nor with itself (or interacts very little with itself). It only interacts gravitationally and, therefore, its presence can be inferred from gravitational effects on visible matter, such as stars, galaxies and galaxy clusters.
            
              Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
